## Planning
I want 2 main files.  The drawing section of the page, and the display section of the page.  All displays will be the same file, just passed different things collections of art (3 main ones, all art, art a specific user has made, and an individual user's favorite peices)

any time you veiw your own art in any of these collections you can press a button to edit, or delete your art
any time you veiw anyone elses art in any of these collections you can press a button to like it, or add it to your collection of favorites
you can also hit a link to the users page, to look at all of their art, or their collection

Icebox will be a search bar where you can look up artists by name, or art peices by name
